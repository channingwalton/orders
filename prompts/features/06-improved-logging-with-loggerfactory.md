# Improved Logging with LoggerFactory

## Objective
Enhance the current logging implementation by using log4cats LoggerFactory pattern for better dependency injection, implicit logger passing, and structured logging capabilities.

## Requirements

### Current Problem
- Current logging implementation creates logger instances directly in each component
- No centralized logger management or configuration
- Logger instances are not properly injected as dependencies
- Limited structured logging capabilities
- Difficult to mock or test logging behavior
- No consistent logger naming conventions across services

### Core Functionality

#### 1. LoggerFactory Pattern Implementation
Replace direct logger creation with LoggerFactory dependency injection:
- Use `LoggerFactory[F]` for centralized logger creation
- Implement `SelfAwareStructuredLogger[F]` for enhanced capabilities
- Support implicit logger factory passing to services
- Enable proper dependency injection and testing

#### 2. Enhanced Service Integration
Update all services to use LoggerFactory pattern:
- `class OrderServiceImpl[F[_]: LoggerFactory : Monad]`
- `class PostgresStore[F[_]: LoggerFactory : Sync]` 
- `object OrderRoutes` with implicit LoggerFactory
- Remove explicit logger parameters from constructors

#### 3. Structured Logging Enhancement
Leverage SelfAwareStructuredLogger capabilities:
- Use structured logging methods with key-value pairs
- Implement consistent field naming across all components
- Support nested context and structured data
- Enable log level awareness for performance optimization

#### 4. Centralized Logger Configuration
Implement factory-based logger management:
- Single LoggerFactory instance creation point
- Consistent logger naming based on component/class names
- Configurable log levels per component
- Support for different logging backends

### Technical Implementation

#### LoggerFactory Setup
```scala
import org.typelevel.log4cats.LoggerFactory
import org.typelevel.log4cats.slf4j.Slf4jFactory
import org.typelevel.log4cats.SelfAwareStructuredLogger

// Application-wide logger factory
implicit val logging: LoggerFactory[IO] = Slf4jFactory.create[IO]

// Component-specific logger creation
val logger: SelfAwareStructuredLogger[IO] = LoggerFactory[IO].getLogger
```

#### Service Pattern
```scala
class OrderServiceImpl[F[_]: LoggerFactory : Monad, G[_]: MonadThrow](
  store: Store[F, G],
  clock: Clock[F]
) extends OrderService[F]:
  
  private val logger = LoggerFactory[F].getLogger
  
  def createOrder(request: CreateOrderRequest): F[Order] =
    logger.info(Map("operation" -> "createOrder", "userId" -> request.userId)) {
      "Creating order for user"
    } *> // ... rest of implementation
```

#### Route Integration
```scala
object OrderRoutes:
  def routes[F[_]: Async : LoggerFactory](orderService: OrderService[F]): HttpRoutes[F] =
    val logger = LoggerFactory[F].getLogger
    // ... route implementations with structured logging
```

#### Structured Logging Usage
```scala
// Simple message with context
logger.info(Map("userId" -> userId, "orderId" -> orderId.toString))(
  "Order created successfully"
)

// Error logging with exception
logger.error(e)(Map("operation" -> "cancelOrder", "orderId" -> orderId.toString))(
  "Failed to cancel order"
)

// Conditional logging with level awareness
if (logger.isDebugEnabled)
  logger.debug(Map("queryTime" -> duration.toString))(
    "Database query completed"
  )
```

### Structured Logging Enhancement
- [ ] Use SelfAwareStructuredLogger for all logging operations

- [ ] Use appropriate log levels with level-aware conditional logging

### Performance and Testing

- [ ] Error logging maintains same level of detail

## Test Scenarios

### LoggerFactory Integration
1. **Service Creation**: Services can be instantiated with implicit LoggerFactory
2. **Logger Naming**: Each service gets appropriately named logger
3. **Factory Reuse**: Same LoggerFactory instance used across application
4. **Dependency Injection**: LoggerFactory properly injected in all components

### Structured Logging
1. **Key-Value Logging**: Context data properly structured in log output
2. **Level Awareness**: Debug logging skipped when debug level disabled
3. **Error Context**: Exception logging includes structured context
4. **Nested Context**: Complex data structures logged appropriately

### Performance Testing
1. **Level Checks**: Expensive operations avoided at disabled log levels
2. **Memory Usage**: No excessive object creation for disabled logging
3. **Throughput**: No significant performance impact on request processing
4. **Log Volume**: Appropriate log levels prevent log spam

### Testing Support
1. **Mock LoggerFactory**: Tests can provide mock logger factory
2. **Log Verification**: Test assertions can verify log calls
3. **Level Configuration**: Tests can control log levels
4. **Isolation**: Individual tests don't interfere with logging

## Implementation Notes

### Migration Strategy
Incremental migration approach:
1. Add LoggerFactory dependency to build.sbt if needed
2. Create application-wide LoggerFactory instance
3. Update OrderService to use LoggerFactory pattern
4. Update OrderRoutes to use LoggerFactory pattern
5. Update PostgresStore to use LoggerFactory pattern
6. Remove old Logging utility if no longer needed

### Logger Naming Convention
Use class-based logger naming:
```scala
// Automatic naming based on class/object
val logger = LoggerFactory[F].getLogger  // gets logger named after containing class

// Explicit naming if needed
val logger = LoggerFactory[F].getLoggerFromName("acme.orders.OrderService")
```

### Structured Context Guidelines
Consistent field naming across application:
- `operation`: The business operation being performed
- `userId`: User identifier when available
- `orderId`: Order identifier when available
- `correlationId`: Request correlation identifier
- `duration`: Operation timing information
- `errorType`: Classification of errors
- `statusCode`: HTTP response status codes

### Error Handling Enhancement
```scala
// Enhanced error logging with structured context
operation.handleErrorWith { error =>
  logger.error(error)(Map(
    "operation" -> "createOrder",
    "userId" -> userId,
    "errorType" -> error.getClass.getSimpleName
  ))("Operation failed") *>
  error.raiseError[F, A]
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Use level-aware logging for expensive context generation
- Avoid string interpolation in favor of structured fields
- Leverage SelfAwareStructuredLogger.isXxxEnabled methods
- Consider async logging appenders for high-volume scenarios

## Future Considerations
- Integration with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- Structured logging export to centralized logging systems
- Log-based metrics and alerting integration
- Configuration-driven log level management per component
