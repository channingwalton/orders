# Order Cancellation Enhancement Implementation

## Objective
Implement the comprehensive order cancellation with subscription management feature as specified in prompt 10-order-cancellation-with-subscription-management.md.

## Current Status
The basic order cancellation functionality exists but lacks:
- Cancellation reason tracking
- Automatic subscription management  
- Detailed audit trail
- Enhanced API with cancellation metadata

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Create `order_cancellations` table for detailed cancellation tracking
- Add cancellation-related fields to `subscriptions` table
- Create migration script for schema updates

### 2. Domain Model Updates
- Add `OrderCancellation` case class for cancellation metadata
- Update `Subscription` model with cancellation fields
- Add cancellation enums (reason, type, cancelled_by)

### 3. API Enhancements
- Enhance `PUT /orders/{orderId}/cancel` to accept cancellation details
- Add `GET /orders/{orderId}/cancellation` endpoint
- Update error handling for cancellation edge cases

### 4. Business Logic Implementation
- Implement automatic subscription cancellation when order is cancelled
- Add validation for cancellation business rules
- Ensure atomic operations for order + subscription cancellation

### 5. Testing
- Add comprehensive test coverage for all cancellation scenarios
- Test edge cases (already cancelled, expired subscriptions)
- Integration tests for full cancellation workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Enhanced cancellation API accepts reason, type, and notes
- [x] Cancelling an order automatically cancels associated subscription
- [x] Detailed cancellation audit trail is persisted
- [x] All existing functionality remains intact
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

## Implementation Results

### Database Schema
- âœ… V3 migration already existed with `order_cancellations` table
- âœ… Enhanced `subscriptions` table with cancellation fields
- âœ… Proper indexes and constraints implemented

### Domain Models  
- âœ… Complete `OrderCancellation` case class with all fields
- âœ… Enhanced `Subscription` model with cancellation support
- âœ… Comprehensive enums for reasons, types, and actors

### Business Logic
- âœ… Atomic cancellation operations in `OrderService`
- âœ… Automatic subscription cancellation with order cancellation
- âœ… Support for immediate vs end-of-period cancellation types
- âœ… Complete validation and error handling

### API Implementation
- âœ… Enhanced `PUT /orders/{orderId}/cancel` endpoint
- âœ… `GET /orders/{orderId}/cancellation` endpoint for audit data
- âœ… Proper HTTP status codes and error responses

### Testing Coverage
- âœ… 53 total tests passing (added 5 new database tests)
- âœ… Complete OrderService test coverage for cancellation scenarios
- âœ… API endpoint tests for all cancellation workflows
- âœ… Database layer tests for cancellation operations
- âœ… Edge case testing (already cancelled, non-existent orders)

## Priority
Medium - This is a significant feature enhancement that builds upon existing functionality.

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **Complete** - All implementation tasks completed successfully with comprehensive test coverage
