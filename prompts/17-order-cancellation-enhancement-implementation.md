# Order Cancellation Enhancement Implementation

## Objective
Implement the comprehensive order cancellation with subscription management feature as specified in prompt 10-order-cancellation-with-subscription-management.md.

## Current Status
The basic order cancellation functionality exists but lacks:
- Cancellation reason tracking
- Automatic subscription management  
- Detailed audit trail
- Enhanced API with cancellation metadata

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Create `order_cancellations` table for detailed cancellation tracking
- Add cancellation-related fields to `subscriptions` table
- Create migration script for schema updates

### 2. Domain Model Updates
- Add `OrderCancellation` case class for cancellation metadata
- Update `Subscription` model with cancellation fields
- Add cancellation enums (reason, type, cancelled_by)

### 3. API Enhancements
- Enhance `PUT /orders/{orderId}/cancel` to accept cancellation details
- Add `GET /orders/{orderId}/cancellation` endpoint
- Update error handling for cancellation edge cases

### 4. Business Logic Implementation
- Implement automatic subscription cancellation when order is cancelled
- Add validation for cancellation business rules
- Ensure atomic operations for order + subscription cancellation

### 5. Testing
- Add comprehensive test coverage for all cancellation scenarios
- Test edge cases (already cancelled, expired subscriptions)
- Integration tests for full cancellation workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Enhanced cancellation API accepts reason, type, and notes
- [ ] Cancelling an order automatically cancels associated subscription
- [ ] Detailed cancellation audit trail is persisted
- [ ] All existing functionality remains intact
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

## Priority
