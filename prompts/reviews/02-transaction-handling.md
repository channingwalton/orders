# Transaction Handling Improvements

## Objective
Ensure OrderService operations are properly wrapped in single transactions.

## Current Issue
OrderService should wrap each operation in a single transaction, not commit during the operation.

## Requirements
- Each OrderService operation should be wrapped in a single transaction
- No intermediate commits during operations
- Proper rollback on failures
- Maintain atomicity for complex operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All OrderService methods use single transactions
- [ ] No intermediate commits within operations
- [ ] Proper error handling with rollbacks
- [ ] Tests verify transaction behavior

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **Completed** - Fixed in previous implementation.
